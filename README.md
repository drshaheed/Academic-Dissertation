# Measuring Disease Burden and Functional Outcome of Integrated Medical Therapies in Patients with Long-Term Ailments: A DALY-Based Approach

## Project Overview
This dissertation evaluates the effectiveness of integrated medical therapies on functional outcomes in patients with chronic diseases like ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis, among others. It employs a Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) approach to assess these therapies at integrated therapy centers that combine Ayurveda with modern medicine and other therapeutic techniques.

## Key Objectives
- **Evaluate Functional Outcomes:** To measure how integrated medical therapies influence patient functionality and quality of life.
- **DALY and QALY Assessment:** Analyze changes in DALY and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) post-therapy.
- **Influence of Factors:** Study how various factors such as disease duration and therapy integration impact outcomes.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Utilized FIM-FAM scale assessments, patient interviews, and medical records from multiple therapy centers.
- **Analytical Approach:** Employed statistical and regression analyses to evaluate therapy effectiveness and factor influence.

## Findings
Initial findings suggest that integrated therapies significantly improve functional outcomes in patients. However, effectiveness varies based on disease type, therapy duration, and individual patient engagement.

## Contributions
This research contributes to a better understanding of how integrated therapies can be optimized to enhance patient care and rehabilitation outcomes, potentially guiding future medical practices and policies.

## Repository Contents
- **Data:** Folder containing raw and processed data files used in analyses.
- **Scripts:** Analysis scripts, including statistical tests and data visualization.
- **Docs:** Documentation and additional resources related to the study methodology and findings.
- **Results:** Summary of findings, including tables and charts illustrating the impact of therapies.
